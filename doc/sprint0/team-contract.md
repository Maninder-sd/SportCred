When working in a team, problems occasionally arise. One source of problems is the differing expectations
of team members. For example, one person may think that an email response should come within 2 hours,
while another may think that 2 days is acceptable.
In this tutorial, your team will work on establishing team expectations. In the space below, write down the
list of agreed upon guidelines that your team intends to follow. Include guidelines for the following:
• methods of communication (email, phone, messenger, text, . . . )
• communication response times (email, phone, messenger, text, . . . )
• meeting attendance (when to meet, whether all meetings are mandatory, . . . )
• running meetings (when, where, face-to-face vs. online, who takes minutes, . . . )
• meeting preparation (whether preparation is needed, what to prepare, . . . )
• version control (what to/not to commit, content of log messages, . . . )
• division of work (how to divide work, who will decide who does what, . . . )
• submitting assignments (when to submit, who will submit, who will review the submission, . . . )
• contingency planning (what if a team member drops out, what if a team member consistently misses
meetings, what if a team member is academically dishonest, . . . ) We suggest that in these cases, a
team promptly seeks help from the instructor. It is important not to let such situations escalate.
The list above is just meant to get you started. If you had any team problems in the past, think about what
went wrong and how expectations can be set to prevent those types of problems.

Team Guidelines (continued)
We accept these guidelines and intend to fulfill them (sign below):





Review the guidelines with your TA and decide which member of your team will keep this form. In the event
of team disagreements, you may be asked to show this form to your instructor.
